2. **Navigate to the Repository:**
   - Changes the current directory to the cloned repository.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Installs the required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

4. **Ensure the Dataset Directory is Set Correctly:**
   - By default, the dataset path is set to the Google Colab working directory.
   - If running locally, update the `BASE_PATH` variable in the `report1.py` and `RLHF.py` files to point to the correct directory containing the datasets.

5. **Run the Main Script to Generate Synthetic Data:**
   - Executes the `report1.py` script to fine-tune the model and generate synthetic data.

6. **The Generated Synthetic Data Will Be Saved as `synthetic.csv`:**
   - The synthetic data is saved in a CSV file named `synthetic.csv`.

7. **Optionally, Run the RLHF Script for Further Fine-Tuning:**
   - Executes the `RLHF.py` script to perform Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for further fine-tuning.

8. **Additional Notes:**
   - Provides additional information about accessing the datasets and running the scripts.
